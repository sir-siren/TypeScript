# Course Update - What Changed?

I updated my [Understanding TypeScript course](https://acad.link/typescript) - what does that mean for you?

If you're a student on Udemy, the new course content was inserted into the existing course - for free!

There, sections have been updated as [described below](#per-section-update-details). Old content is temporarily kept around (~for a few months), more details can also be found below.

# How should you proceed?

I tried my best to provide this new course such that your current learning progress & experience is influenced as little as possible.

Unfortunately, Udemy provides no tools that help me with updating existing courses, hence some side-effects (e.g., changed course progress) can't be avoided.

Here's how you should proceed, now that the update is live.

## If you're currently taking the course

For most sections, you can continue with the lecture you're currently watching. You can ignore any new content that was inserted ahead of the section you're currently going through.

If you're in one of the sections where I replaced the videos with new videos (instead of adding new lectures, see [below](#per-section-update-details)), I recommend restarting that section. You can, of course, go through it at 2x speed to (or manually click through videos) to quickly go through any concepts you might already know.

## If you have not started the course yet

Simply start with lecture 1 in section 1 and go through the course lecture-by-lecture and section-by-section, in the order provided by the course curriculum.

You can ignore any old course content (marked as LEGACY in the section titles).

## If you completed the course already

You can ignore the update since TypeScript itself didn't really change.

Some new features were added but these are mostly niche features which you might never need.

You can, of course, explore the updated content and see if some lectures sound interesting to you.

# Per-section Update Details

There are three kinds of section changes:
1. New lectures added, old lectures are temporarily kept around in sections marked as LEGACY (see [What happens to the old content?](#what-happens-to-the-old-content))
2. Old lectures kept around but videos were replaced, lecture titles were potentially changed
3. New section added

I chose the first apporach if the old section was relatively long and I did want to minimize the impact of interrupting learning progress by replacing videos & renaming lectures.

I chose the second approach for shorter sections where impact is likely to be neglectable and / or where the lecture structure & order remains mostly the same.

**Here are the per-section details:**

1. **Getting Started**
    
    (2nd approach): Replaced existing videos in existing lectures with the new videos.

2. **Essentials (formerly called "Basics")**

    (1st approach): Added new lectures in new section, moved old section (now marked as LEGACY) to the end of the course

    If you're currently going through the old section, you can continue doing so. At the end of that section you find a lecture with a link to the next section you should continue with (which will be the new section 3).

    Alternatively, you can switch to the new, updated section 2 right away and rewatch it from the beginning. This is not required, though.

3. **Configuring TypeScript Projects**

    (1st approach): Added new lectures in new section, moved old section (now marked as LEGACY) to the end of the course

    If you're currently going through the old section, you can continue doing so. At the end of that section you find a lecture with a link to the next section you should continue with (which will be the new section 4).

    Alternatively, you can switch to the new, updated section 3 right away and rewatch it from the beginning. This is not required, though.

4. **Essentials Demo Project**

    BRAND-NEW section! 

5. **Next-generation JavaScript & TypeScript**

    No changes

6. **Classes & Interfaces** 

    (1st approach): Added new lectures in new section, moved old section (now marked as LEGACY) to the end of the course

    If you're currently going through the old section, you can continue doing so. At the end of that section you find a lecture with a link to the next section you should continue with (which will be the new section 7).

    Alternatively, you can switch to the new, updated section 6 right away and rewatch it from the beginning. This is not required, though.

7. **Advanced Types**

    (2nd approach): Replaced existing videos in existing lectures with the new videos.

    Added some new lectures (e.g., about "as const", "Index Types" and "satisfies")

    If you were going through that section, I recommend restarting it - possibly at 2x speed to save time.

8. **Generic Types** 

    (1st approach): Added new lectures in new section, moved old section (now marked as LEGACY) to the end of the course

    If you're currently going through the old section, you can continue doing so. At the end of that section you find a lecture with a link to the next section you should continue with (which will be the new section 9).

    Alternatively, you can switch to the new, updated section 8 right away and rewatch it from the beginning. This is not required, though.

9. **Classes & Generics - Demo Project**

    BRAND-NEW section!    

10. **Deriving Types From Types**

    BRAND-NEW section!   

11. **Decorators**

    BRAND-NEW section!  

    The old Decorators section will also stay online and was renamed to "Experimental Decorators".

    Why? Because ECMAScript introduced decorators, too. TypeScript now supports both the "standard" ECMAScript decorators as well as the "old" decorator syntax it always supported. Hence this course now has sections for both!

12. **Experimental Decorators**

    No changes, except for the title.

    That's the old "Decorators" section - the lectures were not changed. See the previous section explanation for more details.

13. **Practice Time! Let's build a Drag & Drop Project**

    No changes.

14. **Modules & Namespaces**

    (Almost) no changes.

    Added one new lecture: *"Understanding 'type' imports"*.
    
15. **Creating & Running TypeScript Projects with Vite**

    BRAND-NEW section!

16. **Using Webpack with TypeScript**
    
    No changes.

17. **3rd Party Library & TypeScript**

    (2nd approach): Replaced existing videos in existing lectures with the new videos.

    Slightly changed structure, now covering Zod as a modern TypeScript-first library.

    If you were going through that section, I recommend restarting it - possibly at 2x speed to save time.

18. **Time to Practice! Select & Share Place App**

    No changes.

19. **React.js & TypeScript**
    
    (2nd approach): Replaced existing videos in existing lectures with the new videos.

    Changed structure slightly - core topics are the same though.

    If you were going through that section, I recommend restarting it - possibly at 2x speed to save time.

20. **Node.js & TypeScript**

    (2nd approach): Replaced existing videos in existing lectures with the new videos.

    Changed structure slightly & covering additional content about native Node.js TypeScript support.

    If you were going through that section, I recommend restarting it - possibly at 2x speed to save time.


# What happens to the old content?

On Udemy, the old section (marked as LEGACY) will eventually be removed once their consumption has dropped to insignifcant levels. 

Why? Because the course is quite bloated otherwise, students are forced to go through the old content to get 100% progression and Udemy is not a fan of having two courses in one.

An educational announcement will be sent before the old content is removed.
